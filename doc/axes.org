really just so we don't have to screw this up if we take this apart and
reassemble it.

- motor with colored wires: from left, red, green, yellow, blue (corresponding to
  2B, 2A, 1A, 1B)
- motor with ribbon: plug ribbon in in the same orientation as it comes out of
  the motor (with the non-shaft end of the motor up).

this should align everyone nicely.
